## **Introduction**
## **Camera Lens**
A camera lens (also known as photographic lens or photographic objective) is an optical lens or assembly of lenses used in conjunction with a camera body and mechanism to make images of objects either on photographic film or on other media capable of storing an image chemically or electronically.
The two fundamental parameters of an optical lens are the focal length and the maximum aperture.
### **Focal Length**
The lens' focal length determines the magnification of the image projected onto the image plane. For a given photographic system the focal length determines the angle of view, short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses.Focal lengths are usually specified in millimetres (mm).
Here is example how focal length affects photograph composition: adjusting the camera's distance from the main subject while changing focal length, the main subject can remain the same size, while the other at a different distance changes size.
There are two kinds of camera lens according to their focal length: 
 + Zoom lenses
 + Prime lenses
The term prime has come to be used as the opposite of zoom; that is, a prime lens is a fixed-focal-length, or unifocal lens, while a zoom lens has a variable focal length.

### **Aperture**
The aperture indicates the light intensity of that image.A wider aperture, identified by a smaller f-number, allows using a faster shutter speed for the same exposure.[9]
We use F value to describe the aperture.


     F = Focal length/diameter of aperture.


The lower the f-number, the higher light intensity at the focal plane. Larger aperture (smaller f-numbers) provide a much shallower depth of fiedl than smaller apertures, other conditions being equal.
