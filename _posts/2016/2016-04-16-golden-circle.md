I watched TED: Simon Sinek [How great leaders inspire action](http://my.tv.sohu.com/pl/5495164/57708471.shtml) over weekend. The key idea is called golden circle as below, which tell us to communicate from inside out: why, how and what. This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.
